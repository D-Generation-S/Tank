* **Please** keep your Pull Requests focused to a single feature or bug, keep them reasonable sized so we can review it quicker.

* **Please** write always a commit message which is simple and descriptive.

* **Do not** create a new big feature without discussing this in an [Feature Request](https://github.com/D-Generation-S/Tank/issues) first

* **Please** be friendly to any contributor you write to in an issue or by reviewing his code.
